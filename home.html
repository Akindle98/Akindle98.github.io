            <p>Angel Reach is a faith-based nonprofit organization that works with young adults ages 16-24 who have aged out of the foster care system and/or who are homeless.  Many of these youth feel lost and alone.  They are now on their own and have no place to live.  They need our support to help them find their way to becoming emotionally stable and financially independent.  Angel Reach is also a ministry that supports families who care for children removed from their homes by Children’s Protective Services (CPS).</p>
            <h2 style="">Our Mission Statement</h2>
